# 1. Introduction

Flasheyeâ€™s surveillance solution is based on 3D LiDAR sensors, real-time analysis, and alarms. 3D LiDAR sensors are excellent at detecting changes and recognizing characteristics such as shapes, sizes, and distances between objects, when compared to video surveillance. LiDAR technology is based on active sensing by transmitting and receiving light pulses, making the sensor resistant to different weather and lighting conditions. Outdoor LiDAR is able to operate in complete 0 lux darkness and in bright sunlight. In combination with PTZ cameras, you can achieve a robust and competitive surveillance system.

In security applications, LiDAR surveillance can be used to detect humans and vehicles, filtering out small animals and movements from vegetation, and provide accurate coordinates of tracked objects to PTZ cameras. The long range, accurate sensing, and environmental robustness make LiDAR an excellent complement to traditional surveillance. LiDAR surveillance can mitigate false alarms and increase alarm accuracy since the analysis is based on actively sensed 3D data.

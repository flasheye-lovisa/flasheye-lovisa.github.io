Democratization in our case means to make the technology accessible for almost anybody, not just for specialists or engineers. Without democratization of the technology, the implementation of the technology would take very long time. The same goes for the advantages for people in the world that comes along with implementation like better sustainability, increased safety and improved utilization of existing investments.

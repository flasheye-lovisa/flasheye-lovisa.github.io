# A few things that should be altered from the current version

## Things that are incomplete in my own code
- In _sidebar.md, the Strings completed to each chapter is very silly and does not help with anything. It is recommended to change them to something that briefly explains each chapter.
- Each image has a media-explanation to them where mousehovering reveals its content. Although my knowledge is very much limited, it does not completely correspond with the image itself. Change this.
- The file names of each chapter is very long, and could be changed to numerical chapters instead. This makes naming convention and referencing easier. Each image is also connected to each chapter, making it easier to reference as well.
- Many of the images are way too big, and needs to be resized. Since markdown does not really support images beside text, they could be changed/altered to fit this format of text better. Since it is vertically designed, and not horizontally.

## A few questions about the current design
- Shall the docsify-website be private or public?
- How should the images be aligned? And where? Should the context become first or after etc.
- How shall the numbering be done? I have made an example, although the numbers from the sidebar could be removed.
- Should everything lay under one chapter or is it fine as it is?
- What sized font should the subheadings be? They are quite large at the moment.
- What text should be on the coverpage? It is possible with 3 levels of text but it looks very cramped to me.
- How should the firstpage look like, connected to the coverpage? At the moment it is the README-file.
